This is our EECS 594 Computer Vision's final project. This paper studies recent development in face alignment. We summarize and critique three regression based face alignment algorithms. We also implement the supervised descent method. Our implementation of the algorithm reproduces its experiments on both image and video data and achieves comparable result to the one reported.

        <p>* The algorithm can run in real-time. The bottle neck of the demo in this video is due to the video decoding algorithm we used.</p>
