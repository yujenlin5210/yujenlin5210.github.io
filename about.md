<p>Hello, I am Yu-Jen Lin, a software engineer with UX design/research's mind inside. I've worked as a fulltime software engineer in a design agency in Taiwan a couple years where I focused on creating interactable installations for museums and exhibitions. I then got trained in UX design and UX research at University of Michigan.</p>
<p>I love making stuff to create interactive installations to give people fun and unforgettable experience. A few students and I co-found a maker space, DOIIIT Studio, at University of Michigan, School of Information to bring maker culture to the school. I've interned in Universal Creative in Summer 2016 and created a short VR exhibition at the theme park.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm at Universal Creative creating innovative and immersive experiences for our guests.</p>
